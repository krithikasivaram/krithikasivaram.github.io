	\indent Triple flames play an important role in the stabilization of lifted jet flames and thereby influence their lift-off height. In this study, a 2D laminar triple flame burning jet fuel is simulated using finite rate chemistry and detailed transport of species. The jet fuel is represented by using a surrogate mixture, comprised of {\it n}-dodecane, methylcyclohexane, and {\it m}-xylene. The chemical kinetics of this multi-component surrogate are described using a reduced model derived from a well-validated detailed mechanism. 
	%The structure of the simulated triple flames is explored by examining the reactivity of the different hydrocarbons in the multi-component fuel and the radical profiles.

%%Surrogates are often used to represent real fuels in combustion simulations, and are defined in such a way as to mimic certain target properties of the real fuel. For gas phase combustion applications, these targets are mainly: (a) H/C ratio for the overall heating value and burning rate, (b) cetane number for the ignition characteristics, (c) molecular weight, (d) average molecular formula, and (e) Threshold Sooting Index (TSI) to quantify the sooting tendency. These gas-phase targets are oblivious to situations where multiphase processes, such as spray injection, are important. 
%Distillation curves, which are often matched between the real fuel and the surrogate for physical property matching, might not be the best target to represent multiphase effects in a combusting environment. Instead, studying combustion characteristics of an isolated droplet allows to include basic evaporation and phase equilibrium dynamics of sprays in surrogate definition, also being amenable to detailed numerical modeling. Detailed simulations are performed to predict the burning process of isolated fuel droplets at low gravity for neat fuel components as well as mixtures of hydrocarbons relevant as transportation fuel surrogates. The evaporation rate of the real fuel is integrated as a target into surrogate definition by deriving a suitable relation between the evaporation rate of the multi-component fuel mixture and that of the individual fuel components.

    \textsl{Research Assistant, Flow Physics and Computational Engineering} \\
Worked with Dr. Heinz Pitsch, on 
    \begin{list2}
        	\item \textbf{Proposing gas-phase surrogates for jet fuels}\\
%	\begin{list2}
%		\item Using a {\it constrained optimization approach}
%		\item Desired surrogate is defined by matching targets relevant for gas-phase combustion between the surrogate and the real fuel
%	\end{list2}
Surrogates are often used to represent real fuels in combustion simulations. They are defined in a way as to mimic certain target properties of the real fuel. For gas phase combustion applications, typical targets are: (a) H/C ratio for overall heating value and burning rate, (b) cetane number for ignition characteristics, (c) molecular weight, (d) average molecular formula, and (e) Threshold Sooting Index (TSI) to quantify sooting tendency. In this study, surrogates were defined for jet fuels and Fischer-Tropsch fuels following a {\it constrained optimization} approach by minimizing the difference between the real fuel properties and those of the surrogate mixture. 
%The multi-component surrogate fuel's properties are expressed as combinations of individual component properties, weighted by mole fractions or volume fractions appropriately. Structural group analysis is also used wherever applicable, for instance to determine threshold sooting index of the surrogate fuel.
	\item \textbf{Formulating a consistent mechanism for oxidation of surrogate components \\}
%    \begin{list2}
%	\item Compact, reliable mechanism developed consisting of $369$ species and $2691$ reactions counted forward and backward separately
%	\item Describes the oxidation of many hydrocarbons relevant as transportation fuel surrogates -- {\it n}-heptane, iso-octane, toluene, ethylbenzene, $\alpha$-methyl naphthalene, {\it m}-xylene, {\it n}-dodecane, and methylcyclohexane
%	\item Extensive validation against available experimental data in 0D and 1D configurations
%	\item Predicts low to high temperature kinetics of {\it n}-dodecane and methylcyclohexane
%	\item Has the ability to predict polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soot precursor chemistry
%    \end{list2}
In this study, building on top of a base mechanism for small hydrocarbons, a consistent kinetic model was developed to describe the oxidation of substituted aromatics, {\it n}-dodecane, and methylcyclohexane, which are important components of transportation fuel surrogates. An extensive validation for the individual fuel components was performed against several recent experimental data sets. The reaction model maintains a compact size and is hence amenable to chemical kinetic analysis. The ability to predict oxidation at low through high temperatures for {\it n}-dodecane and methylcyclohexane is another highlight of this reaction scheme. 
%A consistent chemical mechanism was developed as a part of this work that can describe the kinetics of substituted aromatics, n-dodecane, and methylcyclohexane, which are important components of transportation fuel surrogates, in addition to n-heptane and iso-octane already described in the base mechanism in Ref. [17]. 
%The ability of the proposed model to adequately describe the combustion behavior of n-dodecane and methylcy- clohexane at low through high temperatures is also noteworthy. 
Further, the well-validated aromatic chemistry and pathways for formation of aromatics from methylcyclohexane oxidation enable the present reaction mechanism to be apt for assessing the formation of pollutants.% in engine exhaust.
